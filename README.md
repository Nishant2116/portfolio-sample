# Portfolio Sample Built with Antigravity AI

In this video, I show how a complete, production-ready portfolio website can be built using Antigravity AI — starting from a simple `build.txt` file and ending with a live deployed website on Vercel.

**This is not a template or drag-and-drop builder.**

Antigravity reads a structured build file, creates the entire web application, fixes errors automatically, and generates a fully responsive Bento-grid based website with video, hero section, and layout — all in one flow.

## What You'll See

*   How Antigravity reads `build.txt` and builds a full web app
*   How it creates a responsive Bento-grid layout
*   How to run the project locally
*   How to push the code to GitHub
*   How to deploy it on Vercel
*   How to assign a custom domain

Everything is built end-to-end in one workflow.
