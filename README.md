# Portfolio Sample Built with Antigravity AI

This is a complete, production-ready portfolio website built using **Antigravity AI** — starting from a simple `build.txt` file and ending with a live deployed website on Vercel.

**This is not a template or drag-and-drop builder.**

Antigravity reads a structured build file, creates the entire web application, fixes errors automatically, and generates a fully responsive Bento-grid based website with video, hero section, and layout — all in one flow.

## Features

*   **Automated Build**: Generated completely from a single `build.txt` manifest.
*   **Responsive Design**: precise Bento-grid layout that adapts to all screen sizes.
*   **Production Ready**: Optimized code structure ready for Vercel deployment.
*   **Modern Stack**: Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the output of Antigravity AI's capabilities:

1.  **Manifest-Driven Development**: How Antigravity interprets `build.txt` to scaffold and build a full web app.
2.  **Complex Layouts**: Automated creation of sophisticated UI components like Bento grids.
3.  **End-to-End Workflow**: From local creation to GitHub handling and deployment.

Everything in this repository was built end-to-end in a single workflow.
